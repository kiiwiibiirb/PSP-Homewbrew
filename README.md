# PSP Homewbrew
This is a bunch of homebrew that I find and have packaged ready for your PSP!

# About
I recently have bought a PSP and modded it, when I went to get homebrew I found out that downloads are all over the place! They aren't centralized like the Nintendo Switch or 3DS scene, so I thought it'd be nice to have a good amount of homebrew for the PSP all in one github repository!

# How it's formatted
I'm formatting all of the homebrew in their own .7z files, where all you need to do is drag the `PSP` folder onto your memory card and that's it!

# NOTICE
I can only confirm that all the homebrew in this repository work on 6.60 and 6.61, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU BREAK YOUR PSP.
